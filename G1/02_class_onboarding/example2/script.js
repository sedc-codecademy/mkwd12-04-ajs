## Reminder App

* Create a reminder app
* There should be:
    * An input for entering the title
    * An input for entering priority
    * An input for color
    * A textarea for adding a description
    * A button for adding the reminder
    * A button for showing all reminders
* When the button for adding is clicked an object
  needs to be created with the properties from the inputs
  (title,  priority, color, and description)
* The object should then be added to an array of reminders
* When the button for showing all reminders is clicked it
  should show a table with title, priority, and description
  columns
* The row background should be the color of the "color" property
